        Image Description:
        <p>
            Corresponding to the set theme, in short, the rendered image visualizes highly reflective objects
            positioned in close proximity to each other thereby presenting an interesting recursive mirrored effect.
            To elaborate on the scene itself, let us present the lay of the land. With resepct to the position of the view plane
            what we see is the front side of the scene - there are in fact a total of five spheres: top (green),
            bottom (orange), left (red), right(blue) and back (cyan-green). Moreover, there is a plane positioned
            in such a manner that is slanted downwards - it is the source of the scene's swarth-like white glow.
            Speaking with respect to the set theme, the image can be interpreted any which way. One can choose to view
            it literally - the image satisfies the theme so trivially such that, there is no need to discuss the matter 
            further. On the other hand, one could, like this team, interpret the image through the lens of self-reflection.
            To elaboarte, this scene was birthed out of a metacognitive excercise on our actions at the time and as such,
            we were embroiled in a ad-infinitum recursive loop of self reflection. Thus, for us this image is best thought
            of as a mental hall of mirrors. Speaking of the
            <a href="https://www.scratchapixel.com/images/upload/ray-tracing-refresher/rt-mirror-maze.png?">
            hall of mirrors</a>, that serves material inspiration for the scene itself. Additionally, the lighting and look of the 
            scene finds its inspiration from <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000040/">Stanley Kubrick's</a>
            <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062622/?ref_=nm_knf_c_1">2001: A Space Odyssey</a> and in particular,
            the so-called, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JY-ajPNQMh0">"Stargate" sequence</a>.
            Well, there is not much else to say then to ask you to watch the film mentioned beforehand 
            and to take a look at our render (click the "5 Spheres: A Reflective Odyssey" heading).

        Technical Deatils:
        <p>
            Moving onto the technical details of the scene itself, the scene concerns itself with the 
            notion of indirect illumination in a scene. As such, to be precise, this image is the 
            result of Whitted-style ray-tracing - rather than being simply content with primary rays alone, 
            we take into account secondary rays that is, we are also now tracing reflected rays as 
            they bounce between reflective objects in the scene. As such, The part of the indirect
            illumination that this models is the specular-to-specular light transport with
            perfect specular reflection. Now, in order to actually achieve the aforementioned effect, the scene
            had to be placed/contain reflective materials and surfaces. As such, the main objects of contention, 
            the spheres are dressed with a traditional 'Reflective' material that allows surfaces to be
            rendered with ambient, diffused and specular direct illumination, as well as reflections. Furthermore,
            this material has a 'Perfect Specular' BRDF - this allows for perfect mirror reflection to be implemented.
            For reflection implementation, the aforementioned BRDF is what caters to the compuatation of the 
            direction of the reflected ray, as well as computing the reflected radiance. Having established some
            of the more setup deatils out of the way, let us explicate more on the reflective phenomenon itself.
            Now, the spheres are arranged so that their centers are effectively the vertices of tetrahedron
            - given the 5 spheres the arrangement is effectively that of 2 tetrahedrons with their bases 
            fused together. Additionally, the radii of the spheres are such that they are just about touching
            (note, none of the spheres overlap with each other). Here, with the precise scene arrangement, the
            set BRDF parameters - ka (ambient reflection coefficient) = 1.0; kr (reflection coefficient)=1.0; ks
            (specular reflection coefficient) = 0.5; cr (reflection color) = 1.0; exp (Phong exponent) = 100.0 - and
            a max_depth value of 200, we emphasize the inter-reflections of the spheres, which are consequently quite
            bright (and the specular highlight on the spheres are more concentrated). Now, we would ask for one to
            take a moment and look at the render itself and in particular, focus on the hourglass shaped space
            that forms between the spheres. We leave this open to interpretation but to us, the pattern formed
            very closely resembles the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle">Sierpinski Gasket</a>,
            a mathematical fractal. While we cannot fully explain the patterned form what we can do
            is posit that it has something to do with the similar recursive structures - the gasket being the subdivision
            of triangles a set number of times while the scene itself is just reflections of spheres. As for additional remaining 
            technical details, the scene is lit by three sources of light: (i) ambient light at 0.25 luminance
            (ii) Point light in the top-left corner of the scene at 3.0 luminance (iii) Directional light in the top-left
            corner of the scene at 2.0 luminance. Furthermore, a whitted tracer is used given that the scene is 
            concerned with perfect specular reflection.

            Given that the scene is ray-traced thus, details of the platform on which rendering took place, must be 
            noted:

        Credits and References:
        <p>
            Only one single reference was used in the creation of this scene that is the, course
            text-book for the ray-tracing module i.e., Kevin Suffern's 'Ray-Tracing from the 
            Ground Up'. The text itself guides completely and wholly as to the implementation and the 
            theoretical explanations of the aspects laid beforehand thus, credit where credit is due - the book
            is like a guided project for building a ray-tracer and as so, we yield it as such.
