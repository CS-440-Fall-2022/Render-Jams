        <h1 >Hypercube(tesseract)</h1>
    <p><h4>Description: </h4> We have always worked on 3-d objects but I wanted to step-up a bit and explore the 4th dimention. While researching I learned that 
    it is impossible to visualize a 4-d image. Since the max we can do is create a 3-d image on a 2d screen by adding some sense of depth to the scene. I also came
across this amazing shape called tesseract or hypercube. It's one of 4-d objects and when we view it in 3-d it would look like a cube within a cube. In geometry,
 a tesseract is the four-dimensional analogue of the cube; the tesseract is to the cube as the cube is to the square. Just as the surface of the cube consists of
  six square faces, the hypersurface of the tesseract consists of eight cubical cells.  This shape is so facinating that it is used even in unity game engine's. 
Inspired from that I have created this where the inner-cube represents the foundation of color (RGB model or CMY model with 4th color being when all are three are mixed) and the outer cube represents all the different
objects that can be creaated using that foundation. I have also tried to should movement in 4th dimention, which in a 3-d scene would just look like the object is
moving closer or far from eye/viewer. </p>

<p><h4>Controls: </h4> move the slider to move the cube in 4th dimention or along the w-axis <br>
press 't'or 'T' to toggle between different color models.  </p>
