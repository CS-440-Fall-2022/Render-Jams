        <p style="color:red">This is just a cool effet I created with prticle systems.</p>
        <p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255)">I used the following library for rendering particle systems on GPU: https://github.com/flimshaw/THREE.GPUParticleSystem.git . 
          Although I origanlly tried to create the particle system from scratch on my own as well. 
          But there were a bunch of complications invloved like how to make particles know of each others position while rendeing on GPU. Which all seemed a bit out of scope of this assignment, so this library takes care or a lot of lower level complications in creating a particle system. Although understanding this library was then a big challenge on it own due to lack of documentation.
          Originally I was aiming to create a fire like effect but in doing so I stumbled upon this twisting effect of particles. 
          Here we have a different effect which models something like some sort of energy originating from a spot and turing around it and slowly fade away.
          This is something which you may see in anime where a charater powers up so you have such effects around the character.
